Demonstrating caching algorithms

## Why

learning software development life cycle

  -requirement collections
  
  -designing
  
  -coding
  
  -unit testing
  

learning how caching algorithm works

## Features

eviction policy : algorithm which determines which element is removed incase my capacity of the cache is exceeded.
